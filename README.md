## About
The "Expense Management System" has been developed to override the problems prevailing in the practicing manual system.
This software is supported to eliminate and, in some cases, reduce the hardships faced by this existing system. Moreover,   this system is designed for the particular need of the company to carry out operations in a smooth and effective manner.

- XAMPP server – To serve our website’s backend   
- Any operating system- Windows XP/7/8.1/10/11, Linux, MAC   
Web Technology Stack (preferred) :  
For Frontend we will use both PHP and HTML.
PHP is the basic technology for backend.
